# admin-dashboard
In order to practice what I learned about CSS Grids from the Odin Project's Intermediate HTML and CSS Course, I created an admin dashboard following the design specs from the course. I created an Admin Dashboard with a sidebar containing the menu, a header with the user information, search and action buttons, and a main content with project cards, an announcements list and a trending list.
