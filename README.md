# admin-dashboard
In order to practice what I learned about CSS Grids from the Odin Project's Intermediate HTML and CSS Course, I created an admin dashboard following the design specs from the course. This dashboard includes a sidebar containing the menu and a header containing the user information, a search bar and some action buttons. The main content includes a grid layout of project cards and a list of announcements and trending items.
